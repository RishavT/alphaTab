individuals for trying to get back to society
now ah i have a few expectations from you

04:16.220 --> 04:22.930
in this course there are few things i must
tell you now as far as your ah tests are concerned

04:22.930 --> 04:29.050
you will have weekly quizzes in the form of
multiple choice tests and there will be a

04:29.050 --> 04:36.000
deadline and that will be declared to you
ah i will not be giving you the slides upfront

04:36.000 --> 04:42.600
i expect you to listen to the lectures and
attempt the quizzes based on your understanding

04:42.600 --> 04:47.280
of the concepts start through the lectures
i will give you the slides that have been

04:47.280 --> 04:54.660
used in the lecturers after the deadline for
that specific quiz has passed so this is first

04:54.660 --> 05:00.280
the second thing i will expect you to do is
ah i will expect you to keep refreshing your

05:00.280 --> 05:08.090
knowledge of whatever has been taught in the
previous ah weeks so week two we will cover

05:08.090 --> 05:14.090
all the the material that has been taught
in week one and in week two week three will

05:14.090 --> 05:19.730
have weeks one two three the test i am talking
about the test ah week four will have weeks

05:19.730 --> 05:24.910
one two four and so on
the the reason this is being done is bit these

05:24.910 --> 05:29.210
concepts build on each other so i have may
refer to something that was start in week

05:29.210 --> 05:36.450
one in say week six i may refer to what we
start in week two say in week seven and ah

05:36.450 --> 05:42.720
unless you have a grasp over those concepts
and unless you have refreshed everything you

05:42.720 --> 05:47.210
will not be able to understand what is being
taught at a later stage and you will have

05:47.210 --> 05:52.680
this slides so as soon as the deadline for
the quiz for week one is over the slides for

05:52.680 --> 05:57.270
weak one will be given to you i request that
you go through this slides ask me questions

05:57.270 --> 06:03.000
